 name: Adding an Overlay to the Map
 description: This example displays a movable map initially centered on the historical centre of <b>Berlin</b> (<i>52.515, °N, 13.405°E</i>) with an overlay of a historical map from 1789 on top of the base map. A public domain image was used as a source, and split it into individual map tiles. Additional tiles are only downloaded when the zoom level or location changes.
